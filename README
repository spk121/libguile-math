MLG's Guile Library

This is a collection of fairly low-level Scheme functions focused on
the boring grunge work of application programming.

Most of these functions will be already present in core Guile in
more verbose forms.  The primary goals of this library

1. Provide functionality under names and patterns which which
   a C or C++ programmer might be more familiar.

2. Provide functionality under a terser syntax than that provided by
   core guile.
